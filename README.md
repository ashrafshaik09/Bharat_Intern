# Bharat_Intern
Contains two mini projects for the Machine Learning Internship at Bharat Intern

This repository contains two machine learning projects that employ linear regression and logistic regression for predictive modelling. Each project includes Jupyter notebook code.

House Price Prediction: In this project, a machine learning model is developed to predict house prices. Using linear regression techniques, the model analyzes various house features and learns patterns to estimate their prices accurately.

Iris Flowers Classification: This project focuses on classifying different species of iris flowers using logistic regression. By considering the length of petals and sepals, the machine learning model can identify the species accurately.

These two projects are designed to showcase the application of regression in specific domains, illustrating how it can be effectively used for prediction tasks. Exploring the provided Jupyter Notebook code allows users to gain a deeper understanding of the implementation details and potentially apply similar techniques to their own projects.
